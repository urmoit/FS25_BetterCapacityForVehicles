More tractors, trailers, and vehicle capacities can be improved. Just let me know which vehicle’s capacity you’d like to see increased!

# What the Mod Does:
- Increased Capacity: Boosts the load capacity of combines, trailers, and other vehicles to hold more grain, silage, or other materials.
- Efficiency Improvements: Reduces the frequency of unloading, allowing you to focus on farming tasks instead of constantly managing storage.
- No New Models: This mod takes the original equipment from the game and adjusts its capacity, keeping the familiar look and feel of your favorite vehicles.

# Why Use This Mod?

Spend more time farming and less time unloading with this straightforward enhancement. Download the mod today and experience the convenience of better capacity!
